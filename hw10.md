# Fill the follow expression
1. (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 or (00001111)2 = (X8X7X6X5(!X4)(!X3)(!X2)(!X1))2
2. (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 xor (00001111)2 = (X8X7X6X5(!X4)(!X3)(!X2)(!X1))2
3. ((X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (11110000)2 ) or (not (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2) = (X8X7X6X5(!X4)(!X3)(!X2)(!X1))2

1. Logic gate：
Logic gates are the basic components of integrated circuits. Simple logic gates can be made of transistors. The combination of these transistors allows the high and low levels representing the two signals to produce high or low level signals after passing them。
2. Boolean algebra：
Boolean algebra originates from mathematics, and it is a formula for set operations and logical operations.
